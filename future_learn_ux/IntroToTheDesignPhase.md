# Digital Skills: User Experience: Accenture

- This phase has 4 key steps:

1. **Design your user journeys**: This includes the steps a user takes to complete certain tasks in a journey while they interact with your product. This includes both online and offline steps.

2. **Creating a visual design**: Visual design is the process of adding asthetics to your design, which can include typogrophy, colours, image styles, symbols and more.

3. **Structuring your site**: This refers to the architecture of your site or app, how the essential elements are organised, how you build together the information, and what youâ€™re displaying to your users.

4. **Creating a prototype**: A prototype is a model or a mock-up or an early version of something before it is built in real life. This can be done for apps and websites, where less detail is included in the initial prototypes and more details are added as the prototype becomes more refined.
