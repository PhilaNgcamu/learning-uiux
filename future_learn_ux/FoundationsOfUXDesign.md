# Digital Skills: User Experience: Accenture

<h1>The Foundations of UX Design</h1>

<h2>User centered mindset</h2>

- What's emphasized is about keeping the user at the center of your design process at all times.
- Consider how your product would impact them.
- Understand (empathise) your user with insatiable curiosity by asking questions like why and what if. In other words, put yourself in their shoes. This gets rid of any preconceived ideas that you might have had initially.
- It's not just about the UI that the customer will interact with, it's about every single exchange they have with your business.
- Think about every experience and how they would react to it. This keeps the user at the heart of every design.

<h2>Key Process of UX Design</h2>

1. User research.
2. Describe and define your concept - what are you trying to create.
3. Design the experience - the interaction between the user and your product.
4. Develop your design.
5. You release your product or your site - continually improving your product or design.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always base your decisions around real data from real users to see how your product or your site is received by people
