# Digital Skills: User Experience: Accenture

<h1>What is User Testing?</h1>

- User testing lets real people practice using your site.
- The value of user testing: Doing it in the design phase before any development can save time, effort, and money.
- After getting the results form the focus group, we can analyse the comments.
- Prioritise the feedback and workout what to take forward to update your design.

<h2>Different types of user testing</h2>

1. Task-based testing:

   - If your design really works, it's important to carry out tasks within your prototype, even it's on paper.
   - Tasks should be based on user journeys.
   - Describe the goal of an activity and data required, instead of how to perform that activity.
   - Avoid leading the user at this stage.
   - See how the user interacts with the prototype. Be general than being too specific.
   - Reassure them and make them feel comfortable by reminding them you are testing the system and not them.
   - If they get start, ensure that the design becomes more intuitive.
   - Se how they complete tasks rather than just how they say they are doing things.
   - Usabilty assess how easy user interfaces are to use and can be measured using a standard set of questions.

2. Real-world testing

- As the prototype has details, it's more important on which platform to test with. For example, this might be a smartphone, a tablet, or a self-service checkout machine. This allows to perform different interactions than a personal computer.
- The are prototyping tools for the mobile app/tablets that can send your designs to.
- This allows users to tap through as they feel, and it's more intuitive than a standard computer screen.
- It's important to consider the environment as part of the real-life testing experience.

3. Gorilla testing

- This type of testing is where you go wild and speak to strangers to get them to test.
- You give them your prototype and ask them questions.

4. Diary testing

- Give someone your prototypes and you let them take it home and use it in their daily life.
- You ask them to record their experience ina diary as they go along.

5. A/B testing

- If you have two versions (version B and B) of the design, you can try them both and see what they do.
- You can even give different versions to different users and track their feedback and their scores.
- It's also a good time to do A/B testing once a site has been launched because this way, you can get real-world statistics.
- Many tools offer an easy way to randomly give a different page to each user, and you can track how these different pages perform. This is called **post-launch feedback**.

> Test as much as possible to ensure the product does what it needs to do.
