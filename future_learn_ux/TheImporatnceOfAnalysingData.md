# Digital Skills: User Experience: Accenture

<h1>The Importance of Analysing Data<h1>

- Understanding user behaviour after launch of the service or product is important.
- It means you can continually improve their experience if you look at how analysing user data can help you with this.

<h2>Why analyse what the user is doing when interacting with your product?</h2>

- After launching the service or product, the deign process is just starting, not ending.
- User testing is a great way to see how people react to your designs
- Use these insights to define the UX.
- However, the **the best evisdence** comes from the experience your users have in real life after you launched.
- Thus, you can be able to collect large amounts of data and get some real feedback on how your product is doing. These questions such as, "How are your sales?", "How many views does your site have?", "How successful is your advertising?" and "What kind of feedback are your user leaving?"
- Collecting this kind of data allows you to diagnose any problems and test different options. It's important to remember that market expectations and needs are always changing, so what's important is to continually review these and improve and evolve your experience.

- Think about some things when assessing your user experience on a site:

  1. Look at how users arrive at your page. Is it through a search engine like Google, an advert, or directly through your web address?
  2. Look at how many people complete a desired action such as purchasing something, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading content, compared to just browsing around. This is called **coneversions**. The conversion rate is the percentage of people who complete a the desired action.
  3. Consider how your users are navigating through your site by assessing different data points - Are they finding what they are looking for? Also, look at how many of your users are bouncing - meaning how many leave the site without engaging? Where do they drop out? How can you prevent this? Look at how much time they spent on each of your pages. Is it appropriate? Do user stay long enough to engage with the content or too short?

- Always do more testing to prioritise what is mostly valuable. For example, adding more features to improve the overall experience.
- The most important actions to take is to empathise with the customer or user.
- Measure their behaviour.
- Designing the experience around their needs.
- This guarantees highest success for your product.
