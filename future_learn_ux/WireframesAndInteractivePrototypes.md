# Digital Skills: User Experience: Accenture

<h1>Wireframes and Interactive Prototypes</h1>

- Wireframe - A term to describe a drawing of a digital screen. It shows where things are and how thy link together.
- The goal is to take user journeys which describe the goals and the steps, and then build out the detail into the screens.
- Never get too detailed too soon and the reason is, the more detail there is in the design, the more the effort it takes to make a change.

- The **level of detail** of a prototype is called fidelity.
- Starting at low fidelity means things are very basic and flows. It's advised to start these on paper and on card.
- As your design progresses, you move to higher fidelity as you add more details in, refine your design, and it becomes closer to the real experience.

<h2>What goes into a wireframe</h2>

- The first parts of the wireframe are navigation and menus.
- Creating an interactive prototype means drawing it in a design tool and adding actions into each of these pictures.
