# Digital Skills: User Experience: Accenture

<h1>Goals and Ideas - "Describe" process</h1>

1. Think about the users goals and the their expected outcome.
2. Ask empathising questions about the product.
3. If they have their pain points, how will they be supported.
4. Think about all the possibilities that might meet their goal and satisfy the personas you have created. A mind map is good way to start jotting out ideas.
5. Have a prioritised list of requirements. See if your ideas meet certain people's needs or personas

> [!NOTE]
> The important part of this phase is to be **open-minded**
