<h1>What is Visual Design</h1>

- By visual design, we also mean ‘brand’ or ‘graphic design’, which is the process of adding aesthetics to your design. Aesthetics in this case means literally ‘how it looks and feels’. But this is a lot more than just adding pretty colours; there are several important things you should keep in mind.
- **Topography** - Describes what you use for writing text: body text, headlines, and buttons. This includes things such as font, text sizes, and colours.
- **Colours** - Something you can use to draw attention or categorise items, and colour schemes are also important for your branding.
- **Image Styles** - Are really important for the look and feel of your page. For example, are you using photography or a cartoon image?
- **Spaces, shapes, and lines** - Are ways to construct and visually divide you page and can help add clarity or emphasis.
- **Symbols** - Are icons you can use for menus, user actions, or content categories - these should be familiar visual cues to help a user.
- **Branding** - This is an important aspect. What is the message that you are trying to convey? You may be creating a brand from scratch, updating one or working within existing "brand guidelines", each of which are different challenges in how you approach the above.

- In contrast you may also hear of ‘functional design’ which describes how things work – such as features or interactions in your app or site – which show their behavior but without any visual styling. And ‘technical design’ is how the underlying technology will deliver the functional design, for example where data comes from or how components are to be built. All come together but are different elements you need to consider.

<h2>Impact of visual design</h2>

- How you communicate with your users through graphic or visuals is incredibly important. This is based on you understanding your users and knowing how you want to interact with them and how they should feel during those interactions.

- Graphic and visual design is a way of you telling your users how they should feel about you and your product before they even get a chance to read your content. Doing it well can be crucial in creating a trustful experience for your users, however poor or inappropriate branding and cluttered visuals can lead to mistrust with the brand.
