<h1>What is Visual Design</h1>

- By visual design, we also mean ‘brand’ or ‘graphic design’, which is the process of adding aesthetics to your design. Aesthetics in this case means literally ‘how it looks and feels’. But this is a lot more than just adding pretty colours; there are several important things you should keep in mind.
- **Topography** - Describes what you use for writing text: body text, headlines, and buttons. This includes things such as font, text sizes, and colours.
- **Colours** - Something you can use to draw attention or categorise items, and colour schemes are also important for your branding.
- **Image Styles** - Are really important for the look and feel of your page. For example, are you using photography or a cartoon image?
- **Spaces, shapes, and lines** - Are ways to construct and visually divide you page and can help add clarity or emphasis.
- **Symbols** - Are icons you can use for menus, user actions, or content categories - these should be familiar visual cues to help a user.
- **Branding** - This is an important aspect. What is the message that you are trying to convey? You may be creating a brand from scratch, updating one or working within existing "brand guidelines", each of which are different challenges in how you approach the above.

- In contrast you may also hear of ‘functional design’ which describes how things work – such as features or interactions in your app or site – which show their behavior but without any visual styling. And ‘technical design’ is how the underlying technology will deliver the functional design, for example where data comes from or how components are to be built. All come together but are different elements you need to consider.

<h2>Impact of visual design</h2>

- How you communicate with your users through graphic or visuals is incredibly important. This is based on you understanding your users and knowing how you want to interact with them and how they should feel during those interactions.

- Graphic and visual design is a way of you telling your users how they should feel about you and your product before they even get a chance to read your content. Doing it well can be crucial in creating a trustful experience for your users, however poor or inappropriate branding and cluttered visuals can lead to mistrust with the brand.

<h1>When to do Visual Design</h1>

- Visual design can be done at various stages throughout your project, so it’s important to know your goals, to guide what to do and when.

1. Early Concepts

Depending on your product or service, some visual design might be done at the very beginning. You might not yet know what your site or app really needs to do or what the content is, but you need to:

- **Demonstrate** some design concepts to other people
- **Communicate** what you’re about and/or,
- **Build enthusiasm** with people

You might also be trying to **define** to yourself what you’re about or gather **feedback** from users on branding and visuals they like. A polished brand theme, logo or sample page design can be helpful for all of these.

2. During Analysis

- This is a visual way of defining how your site or app would work. However, beware! It is very tempting to build visual design straight into these to make them more impressive, however this can cause you issues; the iterative nature of design (i.e. constantly improving it based on user input) means a lot more effort can be spent than necessary updating your design
- Keep your **‘functional designs’** simple and easy to edit, until you’re happy the functionality is agreed. This is called starting with **‘low fidelity’**.
- **Low-fidelity** designs are simple low-tech concepts. These are usually created with pen and paper. The goal is to turn your ideas into **testable artefacts** that you can use to collect and analyse feedback in the early stages.
- You still may want to also have some brand or visual concepts to show people, as described above; do create some example pages in a tool such as Photoshop or Illustrator, but it’s important to keep these separate from your low fidelity prototypes

3. Later in the design process

- Once you have much more confidence about the features you have been defining, now is the time to build more visual aspects into your prototype – this is called making it **‘higher fidelity’**
- High-fidelity designs are **highly functional** and can be interactive. They are very close to the final product, with most of the necessary design assets and components developed.
- High-fidelity prototypes are often used in the later stages to envisage what the final product may **look** like, test **usability** and identify **issues** in the workflow
