<h1>Introduction to Prototyping</h1>

- A **prototype** is a model or mockup.
- The idea is to experiment, test, and communicate your ideas.
- Generally, a prototype will be simple with only a couple of details. Maybe on paper or cards as sketches.
- As you progress with your design, you start to add your details until you turn them into a replica of your website.
- A good place to start is paper prototyping.
- the benefit of doing this is you can make changes quickly and easily.
