# Digital Skills: User Experience: Accenture

<h1>What is User Experience?</h1>

- It's an approach to the design of a digital or physical product or service or real-life service where the user is at the centre of it.

- Also called **User Centered Design (UCD)** - It is about keeping your user at the heart of everything that you are designing.

- To be able to do this, you need to have a good understanding of who the user is, what they think, how they behave, and what they need.

- Whereas, User Interface (UI) is how a user interacts with a screen. UX covers a lot more than that - it's about every interaction that your customer has with your business online and offline.

- UX Design Process:

  - Come up with ideas by identifying a need for your product or site.
  - Research your users - Find out who they are, their needs and their likes and dislikes and how they interact with your business.
  - Iterating - Refining the design based on the feedback of the user. This is done by identifying new opportunities, respond to business changes and user needs and adapt to current market trends and advances in technology.

- The importance of UX Design:
  - It makes more profit for companies.
  - It saves time and costs.
  - Avoid the need of any redesign work.
  - Users expect to find a website or app that is efficient, pleasing and intuitive.
  - It takes **0.5 seconds** to decide whether users like a site or leave. **First impressions** count.
  - 88% of users/online customers are less likely to return to the site after a bad experience.
  - 80% of users/online customers would stop engaging with content that doesn't display well.
