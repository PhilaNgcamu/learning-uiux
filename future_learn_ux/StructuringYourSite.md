- Key Elements that make up the information architecture:
  1. Organising the content.
  2. Think about the personas
  3. Are they clear and consistent in different parts of you site?
  4. Navigation and Signposting - They help users move through your sites. It's important to know where they are, how they can get back or how the can get to another path.
  5. Think about how to search in a website - How would the user look for something. You may group similar products an pages together.
  6. Personalisation - Recommendations based on your profile and history of viewing.
  7. Once all the above points are met, then, test and refine.
  8. Card sorting - Involves writing your categories onto cards and asking people to organise them into groups. Write down your labels or words on notes or cards with some alternatives and ask people what do they understand by these words.
