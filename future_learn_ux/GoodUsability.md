# Digital Skills: User Experience: Accenture

<h1>What is "good usability"?</h1>

1. It's important to make the user experience simple and easy to understand.
2. Make it intuitive. Users increasingly expect to log onto a site or a system without any training and want to be able to navigate it very quickly.
3. Engaging - Users should feel like they want to come back.
4. Efficient - It must be efficient. Can users do in less clicks than what they used to do in eight.
5. Supported - Users have to feel well supported. If they have any queries or seek advice, the design should cater for that.
6. Easy to recover - If user make a mistake or miss navigation, it is easy for them to get back on track.
7. Consistent - It has to be consistent across all different pages of the design or website.
