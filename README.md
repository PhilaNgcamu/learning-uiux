# Great Learning: UI UX

- UI is simply about guiding and appeasing the user visually
- UX is simply about designing an experience for the user.

<h2>Difference between UI and UX</h2>

**UI**

- For the apps/website. find out what the user is **looking** for in the website and it should be easily accessible.
- Example, some texts in that in font sizes may signify how important the text is.

**UX**

- Empathise with the user. What is the demographic (target market)?
- What is the business about?
- What is the product/service? Understand what it does.
- Who do we compete against? Think about what the user would want to see. You may start by emulating designs that fit to your designs.
- Understand what the competitor is doing and how thy are doing it.
- What kind of impact do we want to make?

- In essence: Formulate the questions and critically think. Understand why you are designing the app/design and how will the target market respond to it.

<h2>The UX Process</h2>

1. Research Work

   - Document **everything**. Understand the whole entity/organisation.
   - Find more about the user - his motivations, niche and everything in between or develop user stories

2. Wireframe - Design layout by using Figma (Usually low fidelity)

3. Understand revision requests

4. Create Prototype - Design layout by using Figma (Usually high fidelity)

5. Understand revision requests

6. Test! Test! Test! (Very Important!)

   - User testing is what tells you what the reality of the app might happen.
   - When you start with the whole UX process, you start with the problem that should be understood and the product. Once you create a problem statement, you try to resolve the problem.
   - First start resolving the problem, you need to create assumptions about the product. For example, test the assumption by having the prototype to some people (user-focused groups).
   - Monitor how they behave when interacting with the prototype
   - Test multiple times with different designs/prototypes with the same particular group.
   - Understand what the user likes and what they want which are two completely different things

7. Understand the feedback

8. Then, develop the app/website
